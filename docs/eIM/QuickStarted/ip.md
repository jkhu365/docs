## Configure Bootstrap Allowlist

The eUICC chips we provided have limited internet access. You need to add your serverâ€™s IP to the allowlist (<https://console.sim.express/#/developer/management>), then your device get to access the server after . Maximum 10 IPs can be configured, which need to be separated by semicolons. As shown in the following diagram.
